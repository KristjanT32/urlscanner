# urlscanner
Nice little program to have to escape screamer sites.

<b>What is this?</b>
This is a simple JavaFX program (JRE 1.8 required to work) that may potentially help find deceiving urls.
<h1>OKAY THIS IS A BIG THING TO SAY</h1>
<hr>
It was built to help prevent people getting jumpscared by following links that point to a screamer.
There's quite a few options to customize the scan - it can even download the HTML of the page for you, so you'll be
able to manually review (that said, this is not compulsory).

<b>How to use?</b>
<hr>
It's really quite easy - insert the url (make sure it has the "http(s)://www." prefix) and choose the option that suits you best.
Again, you should just use "Run screamer test" and then choose what the website shouldn't contain (ex: someone told you it's a meme pic, therefore there shouldn't be any videos on it)
<b>!NB</b>Website HTML downloading only works if used with "Run screamer test".

<b>Have fun!<b>
