# URL Checker

<h2> What's this program?</h2>
  Ever gotten those pesky screamers shoved right up your [[BEAUTIFUL FACE]]?
  Well, jokes aside, this program <b>may</b> help you.
  <br>
  This program will scan any valid URL you give it and show you the possible
  <br>
  risks of actually entering the website.
  You can, of course specify <i>almost</i> everything to check for, to make
  the analysis more specific.
  <br>
  (You sort of have to specify something, otherwise there wouldn't be anything to check for :|)

<h2> How does it work? </h2>
<hr>
  So, let me explain what it actually does.
  <br>
  This program is no wizard, but has shown to be quite effective.
  <br>
  Firstly, the program checks the HTML code for the indications of videos, images, links and iframes.
  <br>
  Then, it proceeds to verify these elements according to the options you've selected.
  <br>
  Lastly, it wraps up all of the red flags (if any), and presents you with a nice, heart-warming
  message to let you know, how much of an amazing idea it would (or would not) be to visit this site.

<h2>Hardcoded checked elements</h2>
<hr>
  <b>The program checks the following elements:</b>
  <ul>
  <li>a-tags that contain a href</li>
  <li>img-tags</li>
  <li>iframe-tags</li>
  <li>video-tags</li>
    <li>video-tags that have the "loop" attribute</li>
  </ul>
